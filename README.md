# Simulation of optical dipole trapping of cold CO molecules

The code contained in this repository refers to some simulations I performed during my Ph.D. at LENS (University of Florence, Italy) working in the G. Santambrogio's cold molecules lab. The code (written in C++) is integrated with bash scripting in order to make it easy to use within Linux environment and to directly graphic related findings by means of GnuPlot.
